But the only person here is you so, who knows how long these have been here? Unless... they were expecting you! You contemplate that possibility for a moment before deciding that train of thought is too scary to continue following. You have enough problems to worry about anyway. To the west is a door taking you back to the hallway from your room... I mean, THE GUEST ROOM!",
