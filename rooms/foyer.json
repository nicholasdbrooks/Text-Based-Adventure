Come to think of it, you're not on your bed; where are you? You stand up and look around at your surroundings: you seem to be in the foyer of some mysterious mansion. A southern staircase leads up to the second floor, a doorway leads to the west, an eastern archway leads to another room on your right, and a northern exit sits in front of you. The only furniture in the room is a single pedestal with some knick knacks on it; whoever owns this house must be a minimalist. Oddly enough, you don't see any front door, even though this does appear to be the entrance to the mansion.",
