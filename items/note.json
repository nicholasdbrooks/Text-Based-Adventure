I've said it before and I'll say it again -- she knows. I think even my John is beginning to wonder. Our relationship has cooled significantly and sometimes I am frightened at the thought of a future in a loveless marriage. Things should not be this way.\n\nOur weekly dinner gatherings are not enough. I am counting the hours until she is visiting her sister again. I miss you with every piece of my soul.\n\nDon't you want me to be happy?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMartha",
