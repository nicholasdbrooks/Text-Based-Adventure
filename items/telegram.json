We have named him James after his grandfather. I hope the both of you will find time to come and visit? I know Papa's health is declining. Maybe you should find a different doctor. You already know my opinion about Dr. Peters so I won't repeat it. I just think you should be aware is all.\n\nWishing you both nothing but love and health. Your loving daughter\n\nClara",
